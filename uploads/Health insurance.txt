Health insurance for UAE nationals
Abu Dhabi

Under the 'Thiqa' programme, Abu Dhabi Government provides full medical coverage for all UAE nationals living in Abu Dhabi. Citizens get a Thiqa card, through which they get comprehensive access to a large number of private and public healthcare providers registered within Daman's network. It also includes broader geographical coverage and extra health benefits.

In order to qualify for the Thiqa programme, UAE nationals living in Abu Dhabi who are 18 to 75 years old need to undergo the Weqaya screening run by the Department of Health - Abu Dhabi. The health check is done in order to identify cardiovascular risk factors, and may be waived only in exceptional cases.

Amendments to insurance programmes

The Department of Health in Abu Dhabi announced a number of amendments to health insurance programmes to both the 'Thiqa' plan and the Abu Dhabi Basic Plan. The amendments came into effect from 1 July 2016. They were designed to utilise the health insurance system in increasing overall efficiency across the sector to better meet current and future demands.
